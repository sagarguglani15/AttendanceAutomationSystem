Hello!

	I have developed an AUTOMATED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM that marks attendance with your face data.

	OpenCV: library used to handle cameras
	Harcasscade: To detect faces from OpenCV

	MySql: to create seperate interface for Student and Teachers login

	A student can only view his/her attedance
	A teacher can view his/her as well as students' attendance

	Attendance is ploted using MatplotLib.pyplot and Pandas

	Once you register your face, the system gets trained to understand your face data for future logins.
